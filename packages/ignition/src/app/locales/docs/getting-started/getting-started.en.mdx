# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for <RocketIconsText className="text-slate-900 dark:text-white" />!
This component provides a collection of icons for use in your **React** web and **React Native** projects.
<RocketIconsText className="text-slate-900 dark:text-white" /> utilizes **Tailwind CSS** classes for styling, making it easy to customize and integrate into your applications.

# Why it was created?

<RocketIconsText className="text-slate-900 dark:text-white" /> was created to provide a simple and
easy-to-use icon library for developers who wish to write a single code that can
work both in **React** web and **React Native**. We were motivated by the existence of great
tools such as
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/),
[Expo](https://expo.dev/) and
[React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/).
These tools are great and we love them but we wanted to create an even easier experience
 for developers working with multiple platforms with the same codebase.

The icons are designed to be easily customizable and can be used in both web
and mobile applications.

**Write once, use everywhere!**
