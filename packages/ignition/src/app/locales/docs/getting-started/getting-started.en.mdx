## Introduction

# Getting Started

Welcome to the documentation for <RocketIconsTextDefault />!
This component provides a collection of icons for use in your <SiReact className="-mt-1 icon-sky-800" /> **React** web and **React Native** projects.

<RocketIconsTextDefault /> utilizes <SiTailwindcss className="-mt-1" /> **Tailwind CSS** classes
for styling, making it easy to customize and integrate into your applications.

### Why it was created?

<RocketIconsTextDefault /> was created to provide a simple and easy-to-use icon library for
developers who wish to write a single code that can work both in **React** web and **React
Native**. 

We were motivated by the existence of great
tools such as <SiTailwindcss className="-mt-1" /> [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/),
<SiExpo className="-mt-1" /> [Expo](https://expo.dev/),
<SiReact className="-mt-1 icon-sky-500" /> [NativeWind](https://nativewind.dev) and
<SiReact className="-mt-1 icon-red-800" /> [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/). 

These tools are great and we love them but we wanted to create an even easier experience for developers
working with multiple platforms with the same codebase.

The icons are designed to be easily customizable and can be used in both web
and mobile applications.

**Write once, use everywhere!**
