That is all you need to add an icon to your project.
<br />
Now that you already have the icon, you will most likely want to style it because,
after the possibility that <RocketIconsTextDefault /> brings in sharing code between
Web and Mobile applications, the ease of customizing the appearance and behavior of the icon to
your project is the most powerful functionality of this tool.
