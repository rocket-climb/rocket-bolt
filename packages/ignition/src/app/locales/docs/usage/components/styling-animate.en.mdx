#### [Animations](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/animation)
Animations and transitions can be used with icons,
but this functionality is only available for React.

**React Native has some limited features**. _See the official documentation of [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/core-concepts/states) for more information._
