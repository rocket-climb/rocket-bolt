# How to Use Colors and States

To apply colors to elements in your application and handle different states like hover and focus, follow these steps:

1. Define color values using CSS properties like `color`, `background-color`, `border-color`, etc.
2. Use hexadecimal color codes (`#RRGGBB`), RGB values (`rgb(r, g, b)`), or CSS color names to specify colors.
3. Use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS to simplify color implementation.
4. Utilize pseudo-classes like `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active`, etc., to define styles for different states.
5. Apply the desired styles to the corresponding elements using CSS selectors.
