## Usage
# Using Rocketicons
The icon library for React and React Native, empowered by Tailwind

<RocketIconsText /> is an icon library as part of a solution that enables code written in React to run
seamlessly on both Web and Mobile platforms, without alterations, saving resources and development time,
allowing the focus to be directed towards what matters. Your application!
<br />
As developers who are fans of Tailwind, it was a natural process to leverage this powerful framework to give
icons a significant level of personalization and customization.

I remember being amazed when I understood how Tailwind works, and although I have no affiliation with the
company, this work is a tribute to the contribution they've brought to us devs.
It's a way of saying, thank you very much!"

It was fun to see all that we could accomplish with icons integrated with Tailwind, and we hope you enjoy it as much as we do.

If you haven't installed the package yet, [Getting Started](./getting-started) can be a good way to begin.  
If you're already set up, let's start [adding icons](./adding-icons).
